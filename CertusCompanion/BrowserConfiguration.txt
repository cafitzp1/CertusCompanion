--- Certus Browser Configuration ---

Use this file for configuring the Certus Browser
Edit only in the areas directly beneath the header tags (example - << EXAMPLE >>) up until
the input end point (the triple slashes - '///'). DO NOT leave any white space. Begin input
on the line directly beneath the tag and end on the line directly above the 3 slashes.

<< HOMEPAGE >>

Your user credentials to authenticate when pressing the sign in button (not required
but you will have to manually enter them every time if not included here)

<< USERNAME >>
username

<< PASSWORD >>

The specific status you want items to end up as when using either the complete items
script or the distribute items script. Complete will change the status to '4: complete'
as default and distribute will change the status to '2: documentation analyst'. For your
reference... 1-ER, 2-DA, 3-CA, 4-C, 5-T. I've included this option incase you would like to
trash items instead of complete them or assign items as compliance analyst instead of docu-
mentation analyst... etc.

<< COMPLETE STATUS ID >>
4

<< DISTRIBUTE STATUS ID >>
2

Custom scripts to be used with the browser (the code will automatically generate a function
to transfer the checked items if there are checked items from the Workflow Manager into an array of IDs. 
All you have to do is call the function 'transferArray();' and assign it to a variable such as 
'myData' if you intend on using this array of IDs. If you do not intend on using this array, just 
don't call the function. If you do not intend on using any custom scripts, leave the edit area 
blank or as '...' otherwise whatever you put in that area will be binded to the custom script 
buttons. Same goes for white space here. The script should be fine with white space, just make sure
it begins on the line directly under the tag and ends on the line directly above the end (///).
